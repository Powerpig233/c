1. What does this program print?

int a = 7;
if (a % 3 == 2)
    printf("result1");
else
    printf("result2");
(A) It doesn't compile
(B) Nothing (empty screen)
(C) result1                      
++  (D) result2

2. How many iterations does the following loop has (how many times is printf() invoked)?

int i = 10;
while (--i > 3)
    printf("%d", i);

(A) It doesn't compile
(B) 0
++  (C) 6   // 9 8 7 6 5 4
(D) 7

3. What does the following program print?

char msg[] = "CBA";
printf("%d", msg[3]);

(A) Runtime error: the array msg has 3 elements, we can't refer the one after the last
(B) Garbage value
(C) 65
++  (D) 0

/**/
  char msg[] = "CBA";
  for(int i=0;i<4;i++){
      printf("%d\n", msg[i]);
  }
  //67 66 65 0

4. Which declaration describes a pointer named "point" pointing to a constant unsigned long integer variable?

++  (A) const unsigned long int* point;
(B) const long int* point;
(C) unsigned long int* const point;  //const signed long int* point;
(D) const signed long int* point; // const signed long int* point;

5. Which statement is true in case of the following program?

int* pointer = (int*)malloc(5000 * sizeof(int));

(A) A sizeof(int*)-sized storage space is allocated on the heap which is the address of a space at least 5000 * sizeof(int) bytes on the stack.
(B) A sizeof(int*)-sized storage space is allocated on the stack which is the address of a space at least 5000 * sizeof(int) bytes on the heap.
not sure++  (C) A sizeof(int*)-sized storage space is allocated on the heap which is the address of a space at least 5000 * sizeof(int) bytes on the heap.
(D) None of these

6. What is the type of the expression 5 / 10 + 100 after evaluation in C?

(A) double
(B) float
(C) int
(D) unsigned int

7. Which statement is fals?

++  not sure(A) A variable declaration doesn't always come with memory allocation.
(B) In case of the declaration void x; the variable x can be given a value of arbitrary type.
(C) The return value of main() gives information to the operating system about the success of the program.
(D) main() gets the command line arguments as parameters.
